 * A struct representing a generic component that gets plugged into the arduino.
 * A component is a combination of:
 * - An integer ID - you as the programmer define this.
 * - A type of pin - 'a' for analog, 'd' for digital, and 'p' for PCA board
 * - A pin number - these are 0-indexed and the max value depends on the type of pin
 *
 * Students typically do not reference these directly; rather, they are using the
 * various `getValue()` functions that use these Components behind the scenes.

         * (sometimes colloquially known as a 360 degree servo).
         *
         * The 180 degree servo operates by angle. It starts at a 90 degree position, and
         * you can use pca180Servo() to specify that it move to angle between 0 to 180 degrees.
         *
         * The continuous rotation servo operates by rotational velocity. A speed of 0
         * means the servo does not move. You can use pcaContServo() to specify a velocity
         * in some direction. A positive value will cause the servo to move in one direction,
         * while a negative value will cause the servo to move in the other direction.
         *
         * You can also use pca180ServoTime() and pcaContServoTime() for time-based servo
         * control. Refer to all of those functions to understand the differences in their operation.
         *
         * The neutral values listed above are approximate. You will need to do some calibration
         * to figure out the true neutral values for your servos.
         *
         * Refer to the documentation on Canvas for how to properly wire a servo to your
         * Arduino and PCA board.

         * <b>Note:</b> The arduino / PCA board supports connecting up to 16 servos at one time.
         * However, servos and motors share the same PCA board so the actual number you'll
         * use is much smaller.
         *
         * @param id A unique identifier that you specify. You will use this identifier
         * when running the various pca servo functions, so it's recommended you assign it to a variable.
         * It is also recommended you make it equal to the pin number it is assigned to.
